# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview
In this analysis assignment, there consists three technical analyses that we will have to perform and submit three analysis data:

1. Retrieve Weather Data
2. Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
3. Create a Travel Itinerary Map

A random set of 2,000 latitudes and longitudes were generated, and an API call was made on current weather data for the nearest corresponding cities.

## Weather Data
The analytical data was retrieved from the API call:

- Latitude and longitude
- Maximum temperature
- Percent humidity
- Percent cloudiness
- Wind speed
- Current Weather description

## Vacation Search / Vacation Itinerary
Based on the input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences travelers we can identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. The following maps displays destinations using pop-up markers on a marker layer-map. Also utilizing Google API we were able to create a route efficient enough for our customer between four cities.
